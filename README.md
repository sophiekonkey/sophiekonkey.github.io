# Sophie Konkey's Programming Portfolio


## Assignments 
#### *Character in Processing*
This assingment was one of the very first experiences I had with coding and had the privellage of working on initially in the semester.

#### *Data Visualization*
During this assignment, I visited an interactive visualization of every line in Hamilton by Shirley Wu. It was a fun experience and I enjoyed playing around with the interactive data. Here were my answers and conclusions for this assignment:
1. From dragging my mouse over the visualisation of the Hamilton logo this helps me understand how the musical in chronological order. At the top of the hand is the beginning of the musical and as you drag your mouse down you get further and further into the musical until you reach the. bottom of the star which is the end of the musical. This logo helps you see who the main character(s) are through which more colored dots there are and also when there's a big singing solo through the size of the dot.  
2. The visualisation shows the relationship between characters through songs they sing together. It can tell you how close/deep their relationship or history is based off of how many songs they sing together during the musical. The more songs one character has with another the more significant that character is to the others life/story. 
3. This option allows you to filter and see which characters are apart of conversations/songs with Angelica and Alexander. This helps us recognize which character are often significant to the plot of the musical and who is often seen on stage. The only con is that it's specifically for songs/conversations including Angelica and Alexander and not all characters and songs are apart of this filtered focus for ex. the King. Maybe more options. 
4. Visualising the recurring phrases of the musical helps to illustrate what the most important themes are and what the musical is about. It also shows how the songs were sung and with what emotion to help portray the story. 
5. This was a very insightful and well-thought out project. I think other data-rich sources that could be successful in this type of format is consumer and market audience/profile. Organising it that way for marketing purposes by different information/research. Could be cool and interesting a visually more appealing way and easier to view the data. 

#### *Composition Creator*
For this assignment I uploaded multiple jpg images into one program to construct one single composite image. Here was my final result:

#### *Confetti Project*
This  project contained watching the end of the Processing video on Youtube and following along with it to create our own version of the confetti project. I used different shapes and colors throughout my code to make a fun and unique confetti suprise for myself.

## Projects
####  *Computational Vocabulary*
I used my major, Fashion, to create an htm website page informing about the Jacquard Loom, what it is, and why it is important.

#### *Data, Information,and Knowledge*
This project I explained data, information, and knowledge and how it applied to my major, Fashion. I found and collected  raw data through some WGSN trend reports and put it together into a JavaScript application to demonstrate how raw data is converted into information and how the information generates knowledge.
